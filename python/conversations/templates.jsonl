{"id": "tpl_t053", "desc": "Text - partition size question", "turns": [{"user": "how big should partitions be", "type": "text", "response": "For a simple setup, I'll create two partitions:\n- Boot: ~512MB (stores startup files)\n- Root: rest of the drive (your system and files)\n\nThis works for most people. Want something custom?"}]}
{"id": "tpl_t054", "desc": "Text - swap question explained", "turns": [{"user": "do i need swap space", "type": "text", "response": "Swap is like backup RAM on your drive.

{"id": "tpl_t055", "desc": "Text - password question", "turns": [{"user": "what about passwords", "type": "text", "response": "I'll ask you to create a user during installation. You'll set a password then. Pick something memorable but secure - you'll type it to log in and authorize admin actions (like installing software)."}]}
{"id": "tpl_t056", "desc": "Text - root user question", "turns": [{"user": "what is root", "type": "text", "response": "Root is the administrator account - it has unlimited power over the system. You won't log in as root daily (it's disabled by default). Instead, your normal user can run admin commands with 'sudo' when needed."}]}
{"id": "tpl_t057", "desc": "Text - sudo question", "turns": [{"user": "what is sudo", "type": "text", "response": "Sudo means 'superuser do' - it runs a command with administrator powers. When the system asks for your password and you type sudo, that's you proving you're allowed to make system-wide changes."}]}
{"id": "tpl_t058", "desc": "Text - permission denied question", "turns": [{"user": "what if i get permission denied", "type": "text", "response": "That usually means you need admin rights. Put 'sudo' before the command, or if you're in a graphical app, it might ask for your password. It's a safety feature - protecting the system from accidental changes."}]}
{"id": "tpl_t059", "desc": "Text - why wipe the drive", "turns": [{"user": "why does it have to wipe the drive", "type": "text", "response": "The installer uses the whole drive for simplicity.

{"id": "tpl_t060", "desc": "Text - preserve data question", "turns": [{"user": "can i keep my existing data", "type": "text", "response": "The guided install erases the target drive.

{"id": "tpl_t063", "desc": "Text - restart vs shutdown", "turns": [{"user": "should i restart or shutdown after", "type": "text", "response": "After installation, restart is better - it lets you immediately verify the install works.
